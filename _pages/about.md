I'm excited about building useful things. My interest is in the interdisciplinary applications of deep learning.

I'm the lead developer of [Stanford Open Data Project](https://stanfordopendata.org), and I contribute articles to the [Stanford Blockchain Review](https://stanfordblockchainreview.org).

My research focuses on **deep learning architecture**.
